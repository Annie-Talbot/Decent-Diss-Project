# Decent
A decentralised online social network. This react web app uses the SOLID framework to store any data created whilst using the app inside the user's POD. The data is designed to be completely re-usable, so another OSN application could utilise the same data, but create a different front-end. 

## Give it a go!
The app is deployed at annie-talbot.github.io/Decent/ . Please feel free to sign up and create an account!
